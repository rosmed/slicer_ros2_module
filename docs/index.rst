Welcome to the Slicer ROS2 documentation!
==========================================

This module is designed to enable direct communication between ROS 2 and 3D Slicer.  
You can find more details regarding this module in `Bridging 3D Slicer and ROS2 for Image-Guided Robotic Interventions <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35891016/>`_ .

**This is an early prototype and we hope to add more features soon.**
