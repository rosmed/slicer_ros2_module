Getting Started
"""""""""""""""
==============
Pre-requisites
==============

Before you can start compiling the SlicerROS2 module, you will need:

* Some knowledge of Linux, CMake and ROS 2.
* Ubuntu Linux with `ROS 2 <https://www.ros.org>`_ (tested using
  ubuntu 20.04 and ROS 2 Galactic).
* Slicer 3D built from source is required to build an extension, see
  `Slicer build instructions
  <https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/build_instructions/linux.html>`_.
  Before you start compiling Slicer, make sure we use the
  system/native OpenSSL libraries otherwise you'll get some errors
  when compiling the Slicer ROS 2 module.

  After you ran CMake for the first time, in the Slicer build directory, set
  ``Slicer_USE_SYSTEM_OpenSLL`` to ``ON`` using ``cmake
  . -DSlicer_USE_SYSTEM_OpenSSL=ON`` or ``ccmake``.

* Remember the build directory for Slicer, it will be needed to
  compile the Slicer ROS 2 module.

* Dependency: We use cisst messages for certain ROS2 publishers. 
  The module: https://github.com/jhu-cisst/ros2_cisst_msgs.git should
  be cloned in the same ROS2 workspace (in the `src` folder) as this repository
  (see instructions below - `~/ros2_ws/src/ros2_cisst_msgs`).

.. note:: If you need to build Slicer from old sources, make sure
  ``CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD`` is set to ``14`` (required to compile Slicer
  code along ROS 2).

===========
Compilation
===========

This code should be built with ``colcon`` as a ROS2 package.
``colcon`` is usually installed along ROS 2 but if it isn't, install
it with ``sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions``.  For
now, we will assume the ROS workspace directory is ``~/ros2_ws`` and
the source code for this module has been cloned under
``~/ros2_ws/src/slicer_ros2_module``.

You will first need to "source" the ROS setup script for ROS 2 (Galactic
in this example):

.. code-block:: bash

    source /opt/ros/galactic/setup.bash
    mkdir ~/ros2_ws
    cd ~/ros2_ws
    mkdir src
    cd ~/ros2_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/jhu-cisst/ros2_cisst_msgs.git cisst_msgs
    git clone https://github.com/rosmed/slicer_ros2_module

Then build the module using `colcon` while providing the path to your
Slicer build directory ``Slicer_DIR``:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/ros2_ws
    colcon build --cmake-args -DSlicer_DIR:PATH=/home/your_user_name_here/something_something/Slicer-SuperBuild-Debug/Slicer-build

The option ``--cmake-args -DSlicer_DIR...`` is only needed for the
first ``colcon`` call.  For future builds, you can revert back to just
using ``colcon build``

If the ``Slicer_DIR`` is not set properly (or you simply forgot), you
should see the following error messages"

.. code-block:: bash

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Slicer" with any
  of the following names:

  SlicerConfig.cmake
  slicer-config.cmake

At that point, you don't need to clean your ROS workspace.  You can
fix the issue by running CMake on the build directory for
``slicer_ros2_module`` with ``ccmake
~/ros2_ws/build/slicer_ros2_module``.  In CMake, set ``Slicer_DIR`` to
point to your Slicer build directory then hit ``c`` to configure until
you can hit ``g`` to generate the makefiles.  If you prefer a
graphical interface, you can use ``cmake-gui`` instead of ``ccmake``.
Once ``Slicer_DIR`` is set, try ``colcon build`` again (after ``cd
~/ros2_ws``).

==================
Loading the module
==================

You will first need to make sure the environment variables are set
properly so the Slicer ROS 2 module can locate all the ROS 2 resources
(dynamic libraries and other ROS 2 packages you might need to access):

.. code-block:: bash

  source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash # or whatever your ROS 2 workspace is

In the same terminal navigate (``cd``) to your Slicer inner build
directory and start Slicer.  If you followed the Slicer build
instructions, this should look like:

.. code-block:: bash
		
  cd ~/something_something/Slicer-SuperBuild/Slicer-build``.  You can then 
  ./Slicer

The first time you run Slicer, you need to add the module directory in
the application settings so that it can be loaded.

To do so, open Slicer and navigate through the menus: `Edit` |rarr|
`Application Settings` |rarr| `Modules` |rarr| `Additional module
paths` |rarr| `Add`.  The path to add is based on your ROS workspace
location as well as the Slicer version.  It should look like:

.. code-block:: bash

    ~ros2_ws/build/slicer_ros2_module/lib/Slicer-5.3/qt-loadable-modules

At that point, Slicer will offer to restart.  Do so and then load the
module using the button: `Modules` |rarr| `Examples` |rarr| *ROS2*
